            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p><strong>Name:</strong> Alyssa Drum</p>
            <p><strong>Major:</strong> Information Technology</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Reason for taking ENC4416?</strong> I decided to enroll in this course because other technical
              writing courses were unavailable for this semester. However, I'm glad that I took this class. I've learned a
              lot about how to write in the digital environment and what to be aware of. What I've learned will help me
              grow as a programmer and to understand the type of rhetorical situations I may face online.</p>

            <h3>ENC4416 Experience Overview</h3>
            <p>The course taught me how to analyze different rhetorical situations on the digital environment. What type of modalities should be used in certain situations. I also learned how to analyze the rhetoric and visual designs of websites. The topics that I've learned in this course will help me improve my digital writing and presence online in my daily life.</p>

            <h3>Rhetoric and First Project</h3>
            <p>During the first week of the course, I learned about digital rhetoric. Some key points I took note on was that rhetoric isn't just a surface level thing. It's much deeper than that and the way a software is built and designed can be shaped by one's personal rhetoric. Also, the way one communicates whether it be in person or online constructs the way we communicate in the world. For the first project, I was to jot down my digital-related writing habits down and to reflect on it. It helped me understand what I spent most of my digital writing time on. I was able to reevaluate how I use my time online.</p>

            <h3>Genres & Memes</h3>
            <p>We also learned about the genres that are present on the digital environment. Since their are so many different communities and interest online. There are a vast amount of genres out there on the web. We specifically discussed about memes and how it is a type of discourse used to communicate. I enjoyed working in my group in class and analyzing the different types of memes that are out there. It's interesting to learn what they are trying to communicate with just an image and a few text.</p>

            <h3>Real or Fake News</h3>
            <p>The second project I worked on was to create an infographic and analyze how fake news are spread online. I think that this is a beneficial thing to know, because of all the different articles and news we see online. It's hard to tell which are real or fake. Knowing to not trust everything that is posted online and fact checking it will go along way in preventing fake news from spreading.</p>

            <h3>Web Analysis</h3>
            <p>The web audit project I worked on is one of the assignments that will have a great impact on my career. Being in an IT major we learn about web development and being able to properly analyze a website's rhetoric and it's visual design is important. So, learning how to analyze the quantitative/qualitative aspects of the website is useful. Also, the C.R.A.P Design Principles, one of the assigned readings, is something that I will continously use and look back on when I develop websites.</p>

            <h3>Web Design</h3>
            <p>The last project of the semester is to create a website, blog, or game that summarizes what I've learned this semester (which is this website that you are currently on). After learning about digital/visual rhetoric in this course, being able to create a website and using what I know to create it puts all the topics I've learned into perspective. Such as knowing who my audience will be and what sort of rhetoric and approach I need to use to make my website appealing to them. Overall, the assignment was fun to create and it's something that I can put onto a resume.</p>
